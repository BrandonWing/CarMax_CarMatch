Purpose: The goal of the CarMax CarMatch program it to present the user with a survey 
that, after being filled out, will suggest different cars and models based on the results. 

Instructions:
Upon opening up the file, make sure to hit the "Enable Content" button that will appear
at the top of the sheet. If content is not enabled, the program will not work.

If excel asks you to update the sheet, you can choose to either update or refuse. Regardless of your decision, it will say that the update failed. Ignore this and move on.

When you are ready to begin, press on the "Start Now" button. Answer each question
as you see fit, hitting the "next" buttons to move the following question, or the previous button to go back to the previous question.

Once you have completed the five questions, click the "Find Your CarMatch" Button that will appear on the final question.

You will be greeted by a sheet that contains multiple car brands and their models on the
left side of the sheet. Click on a model or the brand next to the model to see different
year models appear to the right of it.
 
Click a year model of your liking. Information about that car will appear to the right. You are free to explore all car models suggested until you find one of your liking.

Clicking the Retake button will bring you back to question one. Hitting the exit button will take you back to the home screen. It will also allow for selection of the different sheets to reappear at the bottom of the screen.
